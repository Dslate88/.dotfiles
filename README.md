# Engineering tooling
I love engineering and want to maximize my time doing so, by leveraging NeoVim i'm able to utilize keymaps and various plugins to not only make me more productive but to truly enjoy the tools I use for work.  

For example, instead of using my mouse to find a file or some segment of code I can hit a few keys and grep for a file/code, then bookmark it and instantly retreive it.  Less mouse = entering a state of flow for longer perioeds of time.
